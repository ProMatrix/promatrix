Project Notes:
The functions folder contains a NodeJS server
ngFireRemoteServer: publish to the firebase host used for the desktop project

ngFireRemoteServer is used for the desktop project:
1) It assists with downloading from Firebase Storage
2) It gets the server time with the time zone offset

Development Workflow:
1) Get each function working using the project-control debugger
2) Then add it to extCicdServer

importing from project-control:
use import '../../../../NgResources/project-control' directly
or import 'project-control' when deploying to Firebase

Nodemon is installed globally
There is a debug launcher called remote nodemon used to build, watch for changes and launch the extCicdServer
Or, you can use Build:Watch script and the local server debug laucher
